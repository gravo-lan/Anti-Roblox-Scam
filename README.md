## How to not get scammed as a 8 year old on your iPad

1. Don't click links unless you are certain it's www.roblox.com and not something similar
2. Don't download things even if people say you will be rewarded (spoiler alert, you won't!)
3. Don't fill out surveys (you **might** get robux from this at the expense of your personal info)
4. Don't click links if they are surrounded with emojis or very suspicious
5. Don't play roblox
